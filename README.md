#A Gif For You

An app that returns a random gif (fetched from the GIPHY API) related to the entered keyword.  Some of the results are... interesting.

To use the app, enter a word into the text input, press the GIF ME button, and a random gif will appear. Click on the gif to open it on the GIPHY website. Not sure what kind of gif you want? Click the GIF ME button with a blank text input to get a totally random gif.
